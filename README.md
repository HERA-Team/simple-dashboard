# simple-dashboard

A really simple system for making HERA dashboards.

The [server](server/README.md) subdirectory contains files and notes on
setting up a dashboard server using Google Compute Engine. You can `scp` files
to it, and it will serve up those files using a web server.

The [generator](generator/) subdirectory has scripts that make dashboards.
